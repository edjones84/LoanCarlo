# LoanCarlo - Student Loan Repayment Simulator

**LoanCarlo** is an interactive student loan repayment simulator that helps you visualize how your loan balance evolves over time based on your income, loan conditions, and potential life events. The simulator allows you to test various scenarios including salary changes, interest rates, and life events such as pregnancy, layoff, or job changes. It utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to generate realistic projections of your loan repayment journey.

## Features
- **Interactive Inputs**: Customize starting salary, loan balance, repayment threshold, repayment rate, and more through an intuitive sidebar.
- **Life Event Simulation**: Simulate real-world events such as pregnancy (9 months no income), layoff (6 months reduced income), sick leave, or job changes (pay cuts or pay rises).
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Run multiple simulations to observe how different factors impact your loan repayment over time.
- **Visualizations**: See loan balance projections for different starting salaries, with annotated trajectories for top, middle, and bottom performers.
- **Summary Statistics**: Get key statistics like average years to repay the loan and proportion of loans fully repaid.
